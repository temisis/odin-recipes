    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiro is a traditional Brazilian sweet that can be eaten in little balls (like the image) or directly from a bowl, after it's ready. Either way, it's a very chocolatey-dessert, and a beloved one.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Chocolate milk powder or cocoa powder, depending if you want it more or less sweet</li>
        <li>Chocolate sprinkles to garnish (if you are rolling it into balls)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a plate with butter and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix the condensed milk, the butter, and the powder in a non-stick pan (preferably a deep one, as it may rise witht the heat and can bubble out if you are not careful).</li>
        <li>Keep stirring the mixture, so it won't burn at the bottom.</li>
        <li>When the mixture is acting more like a dough, and if you move it, it won't immediately cover the bottom of the pan again, then you can take it out.</li>
        <li>Remove it from the heat and transfer the mixture to the greased plate and spread, if you want to roll it into ball and add the sprinkles. If not, put it into a bowl and eat, it's ready!</li>
        <li>To roll the balls, butter your hands so the dough doesn't stick into it. Roll the balls into a plate with sprinkles in it, to complete your frist brigadeiro ball.</li>
    </ol>
