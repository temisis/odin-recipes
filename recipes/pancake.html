    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe of homemade pancake, a simple, light and airy savoury dish for nights and evenings when you want something special and delicious, but doesn't want to cook an elaborate meal. Can be eaten with fillings, or just the fried dough. It goes very well with sliced ham and cheese, or minced meat. Serves two people comfortably.</p>
