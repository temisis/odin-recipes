    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pudim de leite is a dessert made with sweetened condensed milk, similar to a flan, with a topping of caramelized sugar. It's a very popular dessert for lunch or dinner parties.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs (separated)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 175 degrees C, </li>
        <li>Melt the sugar in a heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Once the sugar becomes an amber syrup after about 10 minutes, pour it into a round baking dish, swirling so that the syrup coats all sides of the dish. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Mix the other ingredients together, then use a blender to make sure the mixture is smooth, with no lumps.</li>
        <li>Pour it into the baking dish, place the dish in a large, deep baking tin and create a bain-marie by pouring boiling water into the tin until half full. </li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes, then remove from the oven and carefully lift the dish out of the baking tin. Leave for at least 1 hour until cool.</li>
        <li>To serve, place a large board or plate over the dish and carefully turn it upside down to take it off from the dish.</li>
    </ol>
